After system installation, must run `sudo nix-channel --update`, to
generate
/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos/programs.sqlite ,
so that command-not-found works.


Might be good to initially have ZFS dedup'ing enabled for the /nix dataset, when most of its size will be populated, and then disable later for performance.


The wiki recommends noatime for the /nix dataset, to improve performance.  I
guess there are no risks with that.  Could set this either as a zfs property or
as a mount option.

Or is the relatime good enough. This is already configured by the ZFS-on-root instructions.
